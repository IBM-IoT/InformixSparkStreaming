# This demo was created and tested on RHEL 7.3 and tested with Informix 12.10.FC7

# NOTES:
# All commands are ran from the directory in which the VII/MQTT demo has been extracted
# If cutting and pasting the below commands, the tab characters may need to be removed for
# the commands to execute properly.

# create the stores_demo database
	$INFORMIXDIR//bin/dbaccessdemo7

# Compile and install the VII shared library
	./setup.sh

# Register the Access method into the stores_demo database
	$INFORMIXDIR/bin/dbaccess stores_demo install.sql

# create some VII indexes
	$INFORMIXDIR/bin/dbaccess stores_demo create_indexes.sql

# Start the MQTT broker
# NOTE:
# For this demo I am using mosquitto MQTT if you are using a different MQTT application substitute
# the equivelant command(s)
	/usr/sbin/mosquitto &

# In seperate command windows start your MQTT subscribers
	/usr/local/bin/mosquitto_sub -t customer -p 1883
	/usr/local/bin/mosquitto_sub -t orders -p 1883

# Run the VII / MQTT demo script
	$INFORMIXDIR/bin/dbaccess stores_demo vii-mqtt_demo.sql

# Known limitations:
# If you have 2 of the informix_socket_streaming VII indexes in different databases that are named the
# same and you drop one of them the other index will not work until the engine is bounced.
